python build-citation-network.py journalfolderpath
python find-scc.py journalfolderpath
Sort the SCC lengths to determine the size of largest SCC.(optional step)
	sort -g journalfolderpath SCCs_lengths.txt
Build the largest scc file by writing the largest SCC to a new file namely "largest_scc_unmodified.txt". The largest scc can be obtained from the file "SCCs.txt"

The file "largest_scc.txt" has to be modified for easy further processing. We remove the ' symbol from the file.
	sed "s/'//g" /journalfolderpath/largest_scc_unmodified.txt >/journalfolderpath/largest_scc.txt
	
python find-all-directed-cliques.py journalfolderpath

The file "directed_cliques.txt" has to be preprocessed and empty lines, commas, open and closed braces has to be removed from it.
	remove empty lines from directed_cliques_in_largest_scc.txt using sed -r '/^\s*$/d'
	remove { from directed_cliques.txt using sed "s/{//g"
	remove } from directed_cliques.txt using sed "s/}//g"
	remove , from directed_cliques.txt using sed "s/,//g"
python remove-redundant-cliques.py journalfolderpath directed_cliques.txt
python finding-pccs.py journalfolderpath threshold
